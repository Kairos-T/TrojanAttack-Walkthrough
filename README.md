# TrojanAttack-Walkthrough
## Background
This is a walkthrough of the deployment of a trojan using ProRAT on an unpatched Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) through a Windows 11 VM. ProRAT is a remote administration tool (RAT) that is a common tool employed by hackers to gain unauthorised access to the system. It is a Windows-based backdoor Trojan that is used to control the victim's machine over a network.

## Additional Notes
This is my first ever walkthrough :P forgive me for any lack of details :"
